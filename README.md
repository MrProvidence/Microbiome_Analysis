# Re-analysis of Public 16S rRNA Sequencing Data

This repository contains my independent re-analysis of publicly available 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data from the paper:

**“Undermining the cry for help: the phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae secretes an antimicrobial effector protein to undermine host recruitment of antagonistic Pseudomonas bacteria” (Kraege et al., 2025).**

The original dataset is fully public and all sequencing data originate from the authors of this study. This repository is intended to demonstrate my microbiome analysis workflow and also sharpen my bioformatics skills and knowledge.

## Key Notes

- This project re-analyzes the **public 16S rRNA dataset** from the study above.
- My analysis includes **five independent replicates**, each processed from raw reads to final statistics.
- The workflow demonstrates:
  - Quality control and filtering  
  - ASV inference using **DADA2**  
  - Taxonomic assignment  
  - Alpha and beta diversity analysis  
  - Differential abundance testing  
  - Reproducible, script-based microbiome analysis using R

## Purpose

This repository is **not** intended to reproduce the full published study.  
Instead, it serves as a demonstration of my:

- Bioinformatics proficiency  
- Reproducible coding practices  
- Familiarity with microbiome data processing  
- Ability to interpret ecological patterns from 16S datasets  

If you use or reference any of the data, please cite the original publication.
